								I am more than pleased with our experience with Toptal. The
								professional I got to work with was on the phone with me within
								a couple of hours. I knew after discussing my project with him
								that he was the candidate I wanted. I hired him immediately and
								he wasted no time in getting to my project, even going the extra
								mile by adding some great design elements that enhanced our
								overall look.
